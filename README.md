# California SDOH Dataset: README
## 1. Executive Summary
The California SDOH dataset was developed to address key challenges with existing Social Determinants of Health data, including data silos, lack of interoperability, and limited California-specific insights. This comprehensive dataset harmonizes ZIP code, county, and state-level data while integrating multiple robust sources, such as SDOH, HPSA, AQI, and County Health Rankings, to provide granular, actionable insights for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers.

### Potential Applications:
Policy analysis to address health disparities in California regions.
Identifying underserved areas for healthcare interventions.
Environmental impact assessments on public health.
Resource allocation and targeted policy-making at ZIP code and county levels.
